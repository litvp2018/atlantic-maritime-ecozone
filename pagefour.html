THIS IS THE FOURTH HTML FILE THAT I HAVE MADE FOR MY GEOGRAPHY ECOZONE PROJECT. 
THIS REVISION: v.0.2 MARCH 20th

	>>Project outline: 
		Technology: Create a website to advertise an ecozone.
		Requirements:	- multiple pages on several different topics
			- multiple photos, graphs, charts (visual elements)
			- (not one large page w/scrolling) 
		Ecozone: Atlantic Maritime Ecozone (includes whole of Nova Scotia, PEI, New Brunswick)

		<p> As mentioned in a previous page, the Atlantic Maritime Ecozone is mainly divided between the highlands found inland and the coastal lowlands. The coastal lowlands contain
		    the majority of the AME's human population, with coastal cities flourishing such as: Halifax, NS, Saint John, NB,  and Sydney, NS.</p>

		<p> Geological landforms that can be found in the AME include: </p>
		<ol id= "Plain">
		    <li> - Pleateaus (e.g. Cape Breton Highlands)</li>
		    <li> - Canyons (e.g. Aspy Fault, Cape Breton Island) </li>
		    <li> - Bays (e.g. Bay of Fundy, NB) </li>  
		    <li> - Lakes, rivers (e.g. Bras d'Or Lake)</li>  
		    <li> - Peninsulas (e.g. Acadian Peninsula, NB)</li>
		</ol>

		    "Photo of a small beach in PEI." /> Above: Photo of a small beach near Charlottetown, PEI. Prince Edward Island is known for it's fertile red soils and sands, stained red due to iron oxide, a pigment that rust is mostly made of.</p>
<p> <img class= "bordered" src = "images/saltmarsh.jpg" width = "1100" height = "600" alt = 
		    "Photo of a salt marsh." /> Above: Photo of a salt marsh in New Brunswick, where freshwater mixes with large amounts of seawater from the Atlantic Ocean. Marshes and other wetlands are on the decline due to land reclamation, causing loss of habitat for some species of wildlife.
