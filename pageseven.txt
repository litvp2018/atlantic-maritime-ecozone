		<p> Tourism in the Atlantic Maritime Ecozone is highly popular, due to the natural beauty of the geological landforms and wildlife, both flora and fauna. The rich culture found in major cities across the provinces also adds to the experience of visiting the AME. From whalewatching in Cape Breton, to hiking through dense forests, to taking a walk by the harbour, or exploring a city's food and culture, the Atlantic Maritime Ecozone offers many unforgettable moments.
