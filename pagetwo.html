THIS IS THE FOURTH HTML FILE THAT I HAVE MADE FOR MY GEOGRAPHY ECOZONE PROJECT. 
THIS REVISION: v.1.5 APRIL 2nd

	>>Project outline: 
		Technology: Create a website to advertise an ecozone.
		Requirements:	- multiple pages on several different topics
			- multiple photos, graphs, charts (visual elements)
			- (not one large page w/scrolling) 
		Ecozone: Atlantic Maritime Ecozone (includes whole of Nova Scotia, PEI, New Brunswick)

		<h2 id= "One"> - Climate - </h2>
		<p> Due to the Atlantic Maritime Province (AME)'s closeness to the Atlantic Ocean, almost all of the cities within the AME have a distinctly maritime climate. So 
		    what does it mean if a place has a maritime climate? A maritime climate, compared to a continental climate, will have warmer winters and cooler summers. 
		    This means that the annual temperature range will be lower. This is because water has a higher heat capacity than soil. This means that water takes 
		    longer to warm up but holds heat for longer periods of time than soil. Also, sea water/water from nearby bodies of water can evaporate,
		    creating water vapour. As the water vapour moves over land, it can cool and condense, forming more precipitation in maritime climates. Continental climates tend to have higher annual temperature ranges (hotter summers and colder winters) and an 
		    overall decrease in precipitation. </p>

		    "Climographs of Sydney, NS and Fredericton, NB" /> Left: Climograph showing temperatures and amount of precipitation in Sydney, NS. Right: Climograph showing temperatures and amount of precipitation in Fredericton, NB. Sydney, NS is closer to the Atlantic Ocean
		    compared to Fredericton, NB, and the data shown in the climographs reflect this. Sydney has a smaller annual temperature range of 23.9 degrees Celcius whereas Fredericton has a range of 28.8 degrees Celcius. Also, Sydney has more precipitation annually, indicating a maritime climate. (1517.2 mm vs 1094.7 mm) <a href = "http://climate.weather.gc.ca/climate_normals/results_1981_2010_e.html?stnID=6486&autofwd=1">Source one</a>, <a href = "http://climate.weather.gc.ca/climate_normals/results_1981_2010_e.html?stnID=6158&lang=e&dCode=0&province=NB&provBut=Go&month1=0&month2=12">Source two</a></p>	
		<p> Overall, the climate of the Atlantic Maritime Ecozone is cool, moist, and has averages of -5 degrees Celcius in the winter and averages of 14 degrees Celcius in the summer. As mentioned above, the climate is 
		    heavily influenced by the moisture from the Atlantic Ocean. The large amounts of precipitation also means that the AME has more storms than any other part of Canada. At certain times of the year, the cold Laborador current and the warm Gulf Stream mix, forming large amounts of fog near coastal areas. </p>
