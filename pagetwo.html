THIS IS THE FOURTH HTML FILE THAT I HAVE MADE FOR MY GEOGRAPHY ECOZONE PROJECT. 
THIS REVISION: v.1.0 MARCH 28th

	>>Project outline: 
		Technology: Create a website to advertise an ecozone.
		Requirements:	- multiple pages on several different topics
			- multiple photos, graphs, charts (visual elements)
			- (not one large page w/scrolling) 
		Ecozone: Atlantic Maritime Ecozone (includes whole of Nova Scotia, PEI, New Brunswick)

		<p> Due to the Atlantic Maritime Province (AME)'s closeness to the Atlantic Ocean, most of the cities within the AME have a distictly maritime climate. So 
		    what does it mean if a place has a maritime climate? A maritime climate, compared to a continental climate, will have warmer winters and cooler summers. 
		    This means that the annual temperature range will be lower. This is because water has a higher heat capacity than the ground. Also, sea water can evaporate,
		    creating moist air masses. As the moist air mass moves over land due to wind, it can cool, forming more precipitation than usual, compared to places 
		    that are not close to bodies of water. Continental climates tend to have higher annual temperature ranges (hotter summers and colder winters) and an 
		    overall decrease in precipitation. </p>
