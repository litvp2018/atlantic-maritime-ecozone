THIS IS THE FOURTH HTML FILE THAT I HAVE MADE FOR MY GEOGRAPHY ECOZONE PROJECT. 
THIS REVISION: v.1.5 April 2nd

	>>Project outline: 
		Technology: Create a website to advertise an ecozone.
		Requirements:	- multiple pages on several different topics
			- multiple photos, graphs, charts (visual elements)
			- (not one large page w/scrolling) 
		Ecozone: Atlantic Maritime Ecozone (includes whole of Nova Scotia, PEI, New Brunswick)

		<p> Large portions of the Atlantic Maritime Ecozone were formed at the same time as the Appalachian mountains in the US, around 360 to 250 million years ago, 
		    when the supercontinents of Euramerica and Godwana were brought together, causing the seafloor to fold upwards. This folding is what formed both the Appalachian mountains and the large
		    plateaus of the Cape Breton Highlands. Did you know that these plateaus used to be mountains? Similar to how the Appalachians have been worned down, the same thing happened to the Cape Breton Highlands. 
		    The Cape Breton Highlands have been worn down due to erosion, forming the flat tops of the plateaus.</p>

		<p> The Atlantic Maritime Ecozone is mainly composed of both sedimentary and igneous rock. Further inland, in areas such as the inhospitable heights of the Cape Breton Highlands, the bedrock is mostly comprised of ancient igneous rock. In lower, coastal areas near sea level,
		    the bedrock is comprised of newer sedimentary rock. The accessibility and the better soil quality has proven these coastal lowlands to be ideal for agriculture.</p>
